Text detection in natural scenes  
Implemented by tensorflow and Tensorflow  

Code for the combination of papers  
[PixelLink: Detecting Scene Text via Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01315), by Dan Deng, Haifeng Liu, Xuelong Li, and Deng Cai.  
[Multi-Oriented Scene Text Detection via Corner Localization and Region Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08948.pdf)  
[DSSD: Deconvolutional Single Shot Detector](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.06659.pdf)
